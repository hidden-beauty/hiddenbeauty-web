        We're sex positive 3D printing enthusiasts and after discovering the
        <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/15/3d-model-clitoris-sexual-revolution-sex-education-womens-sexuality">3D
        clitoris model</a> we started printing and gifting them to our friends. This
        playful beginning only set off a much larger project than we initially
        imagined.
        </p>

        <p>
        Our life experiences and this new model led us to realize that many 
        humans have questions and insecurities about their own body. It is natural
        for people to question the shape and size of their own body, yet there
        are precious few places where you can get real life, useful answers.

        Unfortunately many people learn the wrong lessons from consuming pornography, 
        which promotes a lot of concepts and ideas that simply do not apply to 
        real life. We hope to make models available so that anyone can 
        view, study, download or even print these models without time pressure, 
        in privacy. Printing our models for your purposes should also be inexpensive 
        and reasonably fast if you have access to a 3D printer.

        With this project we aim to give people a chance to see the hidden beauty
        of real people. The humans who modeled for us are normal people -- not
        professional models. We attempted to find a diverse group of people from
        many ethnicities, but we didn't reach our goal. Few people were willing
        to volunteer to be a model. For more information on our models, please
        see our 
        <a href="{{ url_for('docs.diversity') }}">model diversity</a> statement.
        </p>
        <p>
        All of our human models are anonymous and provided written consent.
        We destroyed all source images and personally identifying information 
        as soon as the 3D model was created from the source photos. The human models 
        may revoke their consent to have their 3D models on this site. However,
        it is impossible to remove all the copies that people have downloaded.

        We Are Beautiful was a product of Quatsch und Unfug OÜ, formerly registered in
        Tallinn and created by Estonian digital e-residents. Our models were created 
        near Zürich, Switzerland and the company web site and business were created and
        maintained from Barcelona, Spain.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Hidden Beauty project is an updated version of the site, with a focus on
        human body image and intended to remain online as a frozen archive. At this
        point the project is terminated and no new models will be added.

        <h3>Disclaimer</h3>

        <p>
        The nature of this site is, deep and an evolving topic, especially in these modern times.
        We worked very hard to learn and use the most up to date correct terms, and we have made
        many attempts to find volunteers who are knowledgeable in this field who could
        advise us. While some people expressed interest in helping out, very few actually did, leaving
        us continually searching for advisors. And then a pandemic broke out, which wreaked havoc
        on everything and the few people advising simply stopped communicating.
        </p>

        <p>
        We felt that the site and its use of terminology is good enough&trade; for us to 
        proceed to open this site to the public. It is by no means perfect and it may actually be impossible
        to create a perfect site without any sort of mistakes and one that everyone agrees uses correct
        and sensitive terminology.
