           The Hidden Beauty project aims to allow people to view other humans and to show that We Are Beautiful.
           The human body takes many shapes and forms and we should all be comfortable in our own bodies. Modern 
           society puts an incredible amount of pressure on us to look a certain way. We are constantly bombarded
           with images of attractive people and we start to think that we are somehow inadequate.
