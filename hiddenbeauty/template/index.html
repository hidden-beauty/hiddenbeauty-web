           The Hidden Beauty project aims to allow people to view other humans and to show that We Are Beautiful.
           The human body takes many shapes and forms and we should all be comfortable in our own bodies. Modern 
           society puts an incredible amount of pressure on us to look a certain way. We are constantly bombarded
           with images of attractive people and we start to think that we are somehow inadequate. 
        </p>
        <p>
           We are not inadequate; we're merely human and come in many lovely shapes and sizes. If you've ever
           wonderer if you are <em>normal</em> or are curious about the human body, welcome to Hidden Beauty.
           This site allows you to explore our models in great detail in the privacy of your own home.
        </p>
        <p>
           We have {{ model_count }} intimate models that show off normal human bodies. All of our models are
           volunteers between {{ min_age }} and {{ max_age}} years old and span a wide range
           of <a href="{{ url_for('docs.diversity') }}">ages, body types and countries of origin</a>. We've
           carefully curated all the metadata of our models and are
           releasing the public information while <a href="{{ url_for('index.privacy') }}">carefully protecting</a> the
           private information. We never reveal the identity of our models and this information does not exist online at all.
